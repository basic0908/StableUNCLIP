# EEG-Image inference using StableUNCLIP model


change root path and type of dataset for own use.

A pipeline that decodes eeg into image embedding in real-time(RealTimeDecoding.m), then converted to image. 
The program displays images in repetition, which is used for neurofeedback training. 
It should show your imagined image in multiple cycles. 

First train your decoding model.
